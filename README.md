The **Dotfiles** super-hero coming to **rescue** your system from *bloated configurations 
and I-don’t-know-what-this-do-but-it’s-there* configs.

Dotman is a tool to help Linux users rice and tweak their systems, in an appealing WYSIWYG way.

## How does it work?

Dotman will present the user with a *terminal emulator* and a 
tree-view of the standard dotfiles available in a simple Linux distro.

At first, the user will:
* Choose **window manager** (i3, awesome, openbox, etc)
* Add **applications** they want to use, like zsh, cmus, mutt, ranger.

With these settings, Dotman will *export* the selected configurations with the right formatting, **ready** to use. 

Dotman will allow the user to configure their dotfiles using an intuitive graphical interface, choosing fonts, font size, color schemes, window manager configurations, with lots of presets ready to be exported. 

Each change will be visible live in the terminal emulated at the left side of the screen, so the users have feedback on how each setting affects the visuals.
